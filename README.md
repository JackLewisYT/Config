# Config
These are my personal configuration files for my minimal install of Ubuntu 18.04 that I featured on my YouTube channel linked below. These configuration files include configs for the openbox stacking window manager and the i3 tiling window manager, along with configs for the applications I use on a day-to-day basis.

# My YouTube Channel
I have a YouTube channel where I talk about linux and make tutorials that everybody else does!
